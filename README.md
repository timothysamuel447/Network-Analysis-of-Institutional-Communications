# Network-Analysis-of-Institutional-Communications

We conducted a robust network analysis of email exchanges between individuals in a Research Institution. The dataset comprises anonymized email interactions within a large European research institution, focusing solely on internal communication. Represented as a directed graph, nodes represent individual members, and edges denote emails sent between them. Each node is associated with one of 42 departments, aiding in intra- and inter-departmental analysis and community detection.

The primary objective of analysing the email communication network within the research institution is to derive actionable insights into the patterns of interactions among members and assess the overall structure and efficiency of internal communications. This analysis aims to identify key influencers within the network, understand the nature of departmental interactions, and evaluate the robustness of communication channels.


-METHODOLOGY-

-Constructing a network model of email communications establishes a foundational visualization and quantitative framework, encapsulating the flow of information among individuals. This model enables the identification of complex interaction patterns and anomalies, enhancing our understanding of how communications are distributed across the institution.

-Analysing betweenness centrality illuminates crucial bridges in the network, facilitating information flow between different parts of the organization. 

-Understanding closeness centrality provides insights into how quickly information can disseminate, aiding in the design of effective communication strategies and preparation for potential disruptions in the information flow.

-Exploring inter-departmental communication patterns reveals insights into the collaborative structure of the institution, highlighting whether existing organizational structures support optimal collaboration and information exchange.

-Employing probabilistic models for network analysis enables predictions about future communication patterns and potential changes in network structure.
